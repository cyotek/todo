To-do application in ASP.NET Core 2.1
=====================================

This project was created after reading [The Little ASP.NET Core Book](https://github.com/nbarbettini/little-aspnetcore-todo), a short tutorial that teaches you how to build applications using ASP.NET Core. The main differences between this version and the original is that I did this version using Razor Pages as a gentle introduction into why I would want to use these over MVC.
